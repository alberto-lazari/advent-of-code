## 25 languages challenge
For the year 2022 the challenge is to solve each day with a different language, or more

"Why doing this?" For fun, obviously. Here you won't find any elegant, efficent or fast solution to the problems, only my first approaches with a lot of different esoteric languages

Here is the complete list of the languages that I plan on using (in no particular order):
- [X] Spreadsheet
- [X] Pascal
- [X] R
- [X] SQL
- [X] Perl
- [X] Clojure
- [X] Shell
- [X] Vimscript
- [X] Fortran
- [X] PHP
- [ ] C
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Python
