# Advent of Code
This repo contains all my solutions for Advent of Code problems, starting from the 2022 edition, along with a complete environment to write, test and run the scripts, (kind of) independently from the used language.

## 25 languages challenge
For the year 2022 the challenge is to solve each day with a different language, or more. The environment is built upon this concept, to run the problem parts in an automated and polymorphic way.

"Why doing this?" For fun, obviously. Here you won't find any elegant, efficent or fast solution to the problems, only my first approaches with a lot of different esoteric languages.

Here is the complete list of the languages that I plan on using (in no particular order):
- [ ] C
- [ ] C++
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Ruby
- [ ] F#
- [ ] Clojure
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] Spreadsheet
- [ ] PHP
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] Bash
- [ ] Elixir
- [ ] J
- [X] R
- [ ] Dart
- [ ] Perl
- [X] Pascal
- [ ] Octave
- [ ] SQL
- [ ] Vimscript
