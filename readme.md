# Advent of Code
This repo contains all my solutions for Advent of Code problems, starting from the 2022 edition

I use my [`aoc`](https://github.com/albertolazari/aoc) framework to test and run the solutions in any language

## 25 languages challenge
For the year 2022 I chose to use a different language for every day

"Why doing this?" For fun, obviously. Here you won't find any elegant, efficient or fast solution to the problems, only my first approaches with a lot of different esoteric languages

Here is the complete list of the languages that I plan on using (in no particular order):
- [X] Spreadsheet
- [X] Pascal
- [X] R
- [X] SQL
- [X] Perl
- [X] Clojure
- [X] Shell
- [X] Vimscript
